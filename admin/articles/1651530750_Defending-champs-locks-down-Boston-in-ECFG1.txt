&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics faced off in Game 1 of their second-round of the playoffs on Sunday afternoon in Massachusetts, and the Bucks won the game by a score of 101-89. It was a brutal game from both Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Tatum finished with 21 points, six rebounds and six assists, but he was just 6-for-18 from the floor. Brown turned in a rougher performance, finishing with 12 points, nine rebounds and seven turnovers on 4-for-13 shooting. Neither player looked comfortable defensively as the Bucks slowed them down significantly.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Celtics slowed down Giannis Antetokounmpo a reasonable amount, though he finished with 24 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists for the triple-double. Antetokounmpo was 9-for-25 from the field, but affected the game and had at least a few highlights Sunday. Jrue Holiday led Milwaukee with 25 points, while Bobby Portis and Grayson Allen chipped in 15 and 11, respectively. <br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Defense wins championships</strong>, the Bucks aren't the Brooklyn Nets, folks.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Celtics' defense has earned a ton of (deserved) praise over the past few months, Milwaukee's hard-nosed defense stole the show Sunday.<br>
The Bucks' frontcourt duo of Antetokounmpo and Brook Lopez made life very challenging inside for Boston, which struggled to finish at the rim. Tatum in particular had a much harder time scoring inside than in the first-round series against Brooklyn.<br>
The Celtics shouldn't miss two thirds of their shots going forward, and they could open up the floor more by hitting more open threes (18 for 50 in Game 1). But Milwaukee has far fewer defensive weak links than the Nets while playing a much more physical game. The Celtics will have to work for their offense in this series.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Celtics wants to advance to the Eastern Conference finals, Tatum and Jaylen Brown can't play like they did in Game 1.
We must look carefully Marcus Smart's healthy the Celtics officially listed him with a right shoulder stinger (and right quad contusion) and Smart left the court with some pain and he had problem to walk.
