&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Boston Celtics dropped a winnable Game 3 on the road 103-101 to the Milwaukee Bucks after a poor third quarter and a worst one final minute making some bad decisions, falling behind 2-1 in the Eastern Conference semifinals to the defending NBA champions as a result. That All-Star Celtics forward Jayson Tatum shot 0-6 from beyond the arc and 4-19 overall certainly also had plenty to do with the tough loss due to the magnificent defense of Milwaukee -Holiday, Mattews- which Boston managed to hang around in until the final moments of the fourth quarter only carried on by Al Horford's solid performance with 22pts, 16reb, 5ast in 39:09min (9-17 on shooting and 4 treys).<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At halftime Boston shot 4-18 3fg and Milwaukee did'nt make it better they shot 3-18 same amount that Bucks got in whole game 2. Boston led first two quarter 50-46 regardless of disgusting three point attempts and JT/JB were combined for 5-16 on shooting with 16 points a little less than Giannis stats: 20pts 8-14 on shooting and 9 rebounds.<br>
The good news was Marcus Smart played 12 minutes he seemed was playing through some pain and didn't make any basket but got 4-4 from the ft line.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next quarter was a way of the cross for Boston JT stayed turn off mode with 1-8 on shooting while he played the whole quarter, Jay Brown only made 2 attempts (1-2 on shooting) in 9:18 minutes but he made 3 turnovers. No Celtics players managed to score more than four points (the only one was White). In the other hand Miwaukee had a dreamed quarter with 34 points (12-28 on shooting) 17 rebounds ( 6 offensive), Jrue Holiday added 12 points to his pockets he always keeps quiet but does his job and also was a nightmare in defensive side dropped Tatum offense.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final twelve minutes gave us a closed game Celtics had won this quarter 34-23 but didn't win the game because Al Horford's tip-in didn't count. I would like remark some points what could had helped Boston steal a win at Fiserv Forum because I don't understand why Udoka didn't call a timeout (2 remainings) with 0:40 to play and that sequence finished why Jaylen shooting a bricked layup over three Milwaukee players. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The following possession with 11.5 seconds left Ime called a timeout but the ATO play was awful neither Celtics player seemed on the same page and Smart stole a shooting foul trying to make a quick three but the referees only gave him 2 shoots this call created some controversy. Marcus made the first but second one miss the FT on purpose grabbed his own rebound and tip-in, Timelord wanted tied the game with another lefty tip-in but couldn't and the third attempt Horford put the ball inside the basket but he did late the game had been over. Boston could try to score both FT and next possession reach a quick foul to Giannis (in the best scenario) because they have a last timeout to create a last three-point shot end of game play. It would have been a common decision but not yesterday.
