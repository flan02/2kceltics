&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Boston Celtics have signed Oshae Brissett to a two-year contract with a player option in the second year, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN. Per Keith Smith of Spotrac, the deal will be for the minimum. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brissett has spent the past three seasons with the Indiana Pacers after beginning his career with the Toronto Raptors. The 6-foot-7 forward has seen his minutes wane with the Pacers as they have added slowly added a glut of talent at his position. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past season, Brissett appeared in 65 games for Indiana, playing 16.7 minutes per contestâ€”the fewest minutes of his three seasons with the Pacers. He averaged 6.1 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 0.7 assists per game while shooting 38.6% from the field and 31.0% from behind the three-point line. His three-point shooting has dipped throughout the years. Brissett is a career 34.4% shooter from deep but has been unable to stay consistent from range.<br><br>
