Recap breakdown </br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jayson Tatum scored 39 points, Jaylen Brown had 23 and the Boston Celtics took a 3-0 lead over the Brooklyn Nets with a 109-103 victory Saturday night.</br>
Again making things difficult on Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving with their suffocating defense, the Celtics put themselves in position to sweep their way into the second round with a victory Monday night in Brooklyn.</br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boston started strong first playoffs game away 30-25 where Tatum got 12 points, 4-8 on shooting but most important Robert Timelord Williams III back to rotation after his meniscus surgery. Brooklyn took things where they left in game 2 with KD and Kyrie very cold and their help come from B Brown to keep alive in the scoreboard. At halftime game has no clear owner 53 boston and 50 brooklyn with KD/Kyrie combined for 7-16 on shooting 46% and Celtics duo scored 20 points 7-16 on shooting too.<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Third quarter Brooklyn had lost their mind they scored 22 points, 8-17 on shooting this numbers will seem normal but only JT and JB got 19 points 6-15 on fg shooting 6-7 on ft for Boston, three points less that Brooklyn's entire team. Boston led most of the way before the Nets cut it to three with just over a minute remaining. But Marcus Smart scored on a follow shot, made a jumper in transition before Brown got a steal (thank you Blake Griffin) and dunk to make it 81-72 going to the fourth.</br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last 12 minutes to play and nothing had changed JB/JT had played the entire quarter they combined for 23 points 6-13 on shooting for Nets KD/Kyrie only had shot 5 times that seemed a horror movie in Brooklynland and they got 3 lose in a row. Every fan in NBA knows that nobody came back from 0-3 hole and I (and you too) hope it doesn't happens.
