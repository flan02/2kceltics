&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another playoffs run begins and Boston will face the same opponent than last year -Brooklyn Nets- but some things have changed. Firstly last year three-head monster formed between Harden, Durant and Irving is broken as you know Harden is playing with Doc Rivers in 76ers against Raptors their opponent in first round and Harden's place is taken by Ben Simmons known as (no-man dunk) who didn't play any game this season. But all notices are not good in Boston because Celtic's starting Center Robert Williams known as (TimeLord) had a meniscus surgery and his return is not sure in first round.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the best opponent to start playoffs but Boston's season were from low to high reaching 34w-26l record before the all-star game and 17w-5l later where averaged 111.8 pts (12th) / 46.6% fg (15th) / 35.6% 3p (14th) / 46.1 reb (5th) / 24.8 ast (14th) / 13.6 to (13th) during 82 games played. </br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the other side Brooklyn's season had a lot of changes because Irving didn't play until march, Durant had some injuries and played through pain and Harden... well is Harden and he wanted to be traded 
(that is good for Boston). Those team-stats were 112.9 pts (9th) / 47.5% fg (9th) / 36.1% 3p (10th) / 44.4 reb (13th) / 25.3 ast (10th) / 14.1 to (19th) not bad for the 7th seed in the East. </br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short rotation will be a huge question for Boston because in some situations like Tatum or Brown foul problems, any minor injury, offense drought, Horford maybe can't play 35min per. game, etc they won't have the necessaries pieces to solve any those situations with White, G. Williams, maybe Pritchard as the three bench players that Udoka could use in the first round Boston didn't have more consistent bench players to face Durant and Irving presence. In game styles Boston is using conventional 2 big (with some deep range) and 3 perimeter players (JT,JB,MS) and Brooklyn play through 4-1 with Drummond around the rim and 4 perimeter player outside 3pt line then if nets align 4-1 Boston defense will have Theis or Horford matching-up with KD and I didn't like see that I will prefer Theis in front of Bruce Brown and JT/JB switching to defend Durant. Obviously Marcus against Kyrie. </br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Celtics offense always is playing through JT and JB who every year in Playoffs increase those respective roles in minutes, points, fg attempts and defense it could be negative if some of them have a bad night. They might play around 40/42min per game if this series extends to 6 or 7 games, Marcus Smart running offense with confidence spreading the ball over the floor and seeking for the best available shoot every posession will help Boston's offense to keep alive, trying to avoid 'Hero Ball' or one pass reckless shoot. Another question will be if Can Horford (37 years-old version) play with consistence through series with 6 o 7 games?</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We musn't forget Celtics head coach will face his first playoffs experience then he could take bad decisions or skip to call some timeouts it seems a minor problem but in a potencially game 6 or 7 it could change game's fate.
