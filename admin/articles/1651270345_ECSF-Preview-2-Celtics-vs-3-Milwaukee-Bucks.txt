 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sweeping the Brooklyn Nets out of the first round, the Boston Celtics are ready for Round 2. Next up: the defending NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks. The second-seeded Celtics will have home-court advantage over the third-seeded Bucks, and it is a much-welcomed advantage against a team that features a two-time MVP and former Defensive Player of the Year in Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton won't play in the ECSF due a knee injury maybe Grayson Allen or Bobby Portis will replace him in starting-lineup it depends on the system Buddenholzer wants to run in offense.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a familiar postseason matchup for Boston and Milwaukee, as it will mark their third series in the past five years. Boston won a seven-game, first-round thriller in 2018, and Milwaukee exacted revenge the next year with a 4-1 victory in the ECSF. </br>
The Celtics and Bucks have been fairly even in the playoffs historically speaking with Boston holding a slight, 21-18 win-loss lead. However, the C's have dominated from a full series standpoint, having eliminated the Bucks five times in seven opportunities. <br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Series matchup No. 8 between these teams should be another close battle, as the best defensive team in the NBA is set to measure up against the defending champs. To get you prepared for what's to come. Let's talk about how Boston can take advantage over the defending champ in a seven-game series: </br>
First of all we should analyze differences between Nets an Bucks. Boston will have a lot of problems attacking the basket because of Portis, Lopez and the Greek are a muscular beasts with 7'0'' feets their presence below the rym is a primary headache for Tatum's, Brown's layups and that scenario didn't happen against Nets with Drummond, Claxton, Griffin playing lazy and weak defense under the basket. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover Bucks bigs can shoot beyond the arc another problem for Boston because must defend Lopez and Portis while they are playing double-team on Giannis with Durant it was more effective but Drummond, Claxton and Griffin weren't reliables shooting outside the 3pt line. Nets hadn't sharpshooters like Bucks except Seth Curry. For Milwaukee Pat Connaughton and Grayson Allen plus Jrue Holiday could kill Celtics defense if they are on a good day.
