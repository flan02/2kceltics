&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June is on the books and every Boston Celtics fan were felt so sad because Brad Stevens decided to trade Marcus Smart (heart and soul of the team) for Kristap Porzingis from Washington Wizard and 2 first round picks via Memphis Grizzlies (2024-2025). Boston also sent Danilo Gallinari (he didn't play with Boston last season -knee injury-), Mike Muscala and 35th pick in 2023 draft to Washington Wizards and Memphis Grizzlies add Marcus Smart to their backcourt which will be a better fit now that Dylon Brooks won't continue playing for Memphis.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stevens thought that Celtics roster will need some changes and he tried to balance it. Add some inches, low-post offense presence and three point shoot to space the floor some skills that Horford offered previous seasons but last playoffs he had more downs than highs, Robert Williams doesn't shoot behind the-arc. It's all good things about Porzingis if we don't talk about his injury prone we know Porzingis tore right knee ligament and he was 18 months without while he was member of New York Knicks. After that he was traded to Dallas Mavericks to join with Luka Doncic and create a duo but that didn't work and finally he was moved to Washington Wizard to play alongside Bradley Beal.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other hand the "Unicorn" last season played his best basketball offense and he got career max in points per game 22.3ppg with 8.3 rebounds in 65 games record in games played in a season too. "Health" will be the word than define his next season because he will must go deep in a playoffs run and play 20, 25 games with only one day of rest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway in draft night Stevens did a karate-move like and he converted our 35th pick in 4 future 2nd round pick and Stevens selected in the 38th pick in 2023 draft  former Razorback de Arkansas -Jordan Walsh-. Brad said Jordan he is ready to contribute from day one a lot of defense and intensity and through the years and experience Jordan will be able to improve in other skills like 3pt shoot, playmaking, dribbling, etc.
