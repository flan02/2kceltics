&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks are so close competitively. They finished the season with the same record. They play two of the best defenses in the league. They focus their offense on their stars and the stars make the players around them better. They're style of play isn't the same, they go about their gameplans in different ways, but the end result is largely the same. So, it shouldn't come as any great surprise that this series has gone seven games with both teams winning twice on their opponent's homecourt.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Boston Celtics held a 14 point lead heading into the 4th quarter of Game 5 on Wednesday night, with a chance to go ahead 3-2 in the series against the Milwaukee Bucks. However, following a slew of wasted possessions, bad defense, and sloppy play, the Celtics allowed the Bucks back into the game.<br>
&nbsp;The Bucks came storming back, however, outscoring Boston 33-14 down the stretch en route to a stunning 110-107 victory. Giannis Antetokounmpo (40 points, 11 rebounds) and Jrue Holiday (24 points, eight rebounds, eight assists) played key roles in Milwaukee's comeback, while Bobby Portis's putback layup with 11.4 seconds remaining proved to be the difference.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a put back by Bobby Portis following a blown rebound by the Celtics, Marcus Smart was blocked by Jrue Holiday and the Bucks recovered the ball. After another turnover, the loss was sealed for Boston and the Bucks completed a comeback to win 110-107. Defense wins championships as The Celtics played well offensively for most of the night, but the Bucks put the clamps on Boston late to engineer their comeback. Holiday in particular was a defensive menace, his signature play a block on Smart with 8.7 seconds remaining and his team up by one point.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown combined to score 60 points (34 and 26, respectively) for Boston, while Marcus Smart added 15 points on 6-of-11 shooting. If there's one area where Milwaukee had the clear advantage in Game 5, it was on the offensive glass. The Bucks racked up 17 offensive rebounds to Boston's five, none more important than the late putback by Portis, who had seven offensive boards. That means one thing Celtics needs Rob Williams like air to breath. <br>
