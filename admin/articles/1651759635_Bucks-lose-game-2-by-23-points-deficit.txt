&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boston tied series 1-1 in ECSF with a relentless win over Milwaukee Bucks. They dominated the game since the start until the last minute and Mike Buddenholzer couldn't find answers to stop the bleeding during all entire game. Pay attention to the following data, in first quarter JB and JT were combined for 22 points (8-11 on field goals attempts and 4-4 beyond the arc) and entire Bucks team got 21 points (8-20 on fg attempts) at the end of 1st quarter Celtics was winning 32-21.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At halftime the game didn't look good for Bucks because they were down by 25 ( Celtics 65 - Bucks 40 ) and their primary players Giannis (2-12 on shooting) and Holiday (4-11 on shooting) couldn't stop  JB with 25 points and JT with 10 points almost same amount of entire bucks team. It's important to say Marcus Smart suffered multiple injuries during game 1. He suffered a stinger to his right arm that briefly removed him from play in 2nd quarter and he leave the game with a contusion to his right tight that is a bit more serious then he didn't play in game 2. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third quarter looked like the awake of the beast with Giannis shooting 8-11 (18 points) and Mikwaukee won this quarter 26-18. We could add that we saw a very short rotation for Boston where Udoka didn't show confidence in any of his bench players, I think Nesmith deserve a chance, Theis played good againts Nets in 1st round but in exchange Udoka rewarded White with a lot of minutes even though he was playing very badly.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last quarter offers nothing to remark but after the game we looked the boxscore and found some important points:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Bucks was 3-18 on 3pt shooting 0.167 percent awful it happens because Boston changed their defensive double-team system to man-to-man defense what allowed to stop comfortable 3pt fg by their perimeter players.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Bucks short rotation also will be a problem for them in the following games, they only can count with G. Allen and P. Connaughton as a reliables players, Jevon Carter has no the level to stop Celtics players on defense (Tatum posted him on third quarter and made the basket and one) but in offense he didn't have an impact because only made one attempt in 18:34 minutes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Jay brothers impact they combined for 11-20 beyond the arc, this is very simple every single game Boston depends on the two of them, not one because otherwise Celtics will always have some troubles to get the wins for coming.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Game 3 will be play next Saturday at the Fiserv Forum Center at 3pm.
